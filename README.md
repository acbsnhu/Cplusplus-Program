# Cplusplus-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to make a clock the showed both 12 and 24 hour time correctly.
While allowing the user to change seconds, minutes, or time by adding one and when needed to.
This project solved the problem with reading clocks correctly with the 12 hour and 24 hour format.
The 12 hour corectly matched the 24 hour clock with using am and pm at the end of the time.

What did you do particularly well?
I think i kept the code dorganized and easy to follow so that future programmers can look at it and understand what
I did and modify it if they need to reflect different requirements

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think that having clearer notes might improve the read ability of the code.
even though i think my code is easy to follow if someone is not particular strong in following the logic and syntax 
having better ntes might be better for them to understand.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I had a hard time implemting the am and pm on the 12 hour clock to refelct when noon and midnight changed them.
I overcame it my reviewing my notes from the workbook and also watched some tutorial on youtbe on c++ code formating.
I have come very good at using google and youtube tutorial videos to help and they have been a great add to my support network.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
i think that it was a great starter project that helped me maniulate the screen to show the clocks how i wanted them to be shown
It also helped me in not giving up when I got stuck.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to keep the code simple but also doing what it had to do.
Also it was written taking in accounnt orgaization of lines and using the correct whitespace
Also in the future when i get better and more comfortable i could add more features too it or someone else can.
